AnalysisÂ¶
While Rural fares are higher on average, the sheer volume of rides in urban locales lead to a much higher reveneue stream.
Urban locations also brought in the lion's share of Pyber drivers. Perhaps this is due to the larger volume of rides, but it just as easily could be the other way around. More research will be needed to understand why there are so many more Pyber drivers in Urban locations.
Rural drivers appear to be doing the most amount of work per individual driver. Making up just 2.6% of the driver population, they're responsible for almost three times as many fares. Conversely, Urban drivers appear to be doing less work per individual. More research would be needed to determine if increasing the amount of rural drivers would make a positive impact.
